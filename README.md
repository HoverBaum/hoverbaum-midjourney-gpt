## Example usage

Based on the prompt `Whimsical watercolor of a mice family` you can see the baseline Midjourney version and the Image Wizard improved version below.

The full Image Wizard generated prompt is: `family of mice, dressed in quaint, colorful clothing, in a cozy, cottage-like setting. The medium is watercolor, with a style reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations by Beatrix Potter. The lighting is soft and warm, giving a sense of comfort and homeliness. The colors are gentle pastels with touches of brighter hues to add a playful, whimsical feel. The composition is a close-up, focusing on the family's interaction, perhaps gathered around a tiny dinner table or reading a book together. The painting should capture the delicate textures of the watercolor medium, emphasizing the soft fur of the mice and the textures of their clothing and surroundings.`
